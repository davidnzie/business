                    <p>In the world of coffee, not every press, coffee maker, espresso machine, or other contraption for making the potent brew is equal. There is no one way to make coffee, and limiting yourself to one method of getting the job done is not a way to live, as you’ll miss out on the fullness that coffee can have.</p><p>However, if you want the perfect cup of coffee every single time, you’re going to have to get the right machinery, and you might even have to make it yourself every morning to get it right. Do your research. Try different methods of brewing and see which appeals to you. The quality of a cup of coffee is measured in part by the machine doing the work, so this is a crucial first step to achieving perfection in your cup.</p>

                    <p>Not only has it been said that coffee can help improve your memory, but aside from all of that, each cup of coffee counts as your water intake for the day. That means that unlike things like soda and beer, coffee actually replenishes the water your system is made up of, just like drinking an actual glass of water.</p><p>If you are a caffeinated coffee drinker you’ll probably also notice the benefits of the extra energy that caffeine boost gives you, which can be helpful getting through morning meetings. You’ll find caffeine used in diet and weight loss products because it gives people energy.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Your recipe for perfection in a cup of coffee is all about measurements. If you don’t have the kind of personality where you abide by recipes, it would be good for you to actually get down a system of measurement.</p><p>It’s okay to wake up, throw some beans in the pot, put as much water in as you think you’re going to drink that day, and just splash some cream, sugar, and whatever else you like in the cup, but it’s a guessing game this way. If you want a perfect cup of coffee every single time, get out the tea spoons, pour the cream a spoon at a time, and take note of how much cream and sugar makes a perfect cup of coffee in your mind.</p>
